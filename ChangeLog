	* stetic/wrapper: Rename "wrappers" dir to "wrapper", to match the
	namespace

	* stetic/Makefile.am (stetic_exe_SOURCES): update for that

2004-12-15  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* stetic/Stetic.cs: 
	* stetic/WidgetSite.cs: 
	* stetic/wrappers/Table.cs: Clean up new mcs warnings

	* stetic/PropertyEditors.cs (Enum): Redo this using ComboBox to
	avoid the warning about OptionMenu being deprecated
	(Flags): Make this a no-op for now. The OptionMenu-based
	implementation wasn't very useful anyway.

2004-12-14  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* stetic/*Wrapper.cs: Move these all to stetic/wrappers and rename

	* stetic/DefaultWidgets.cs: Moved out of stetic/WidgetFactory.cs

	* stetic/Makefile.am (stetic_exe_SOURCES): Update

2004-12-13  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* stetic/PropertyEditors.cs (Enum, Flags): implement these by
	using private classes rather than anonymous delegates, to work
	around 69614.

	* stetic/TableWrapper.cs: fix a search-and-replace-o ("placesite"
	instead of "placeholder")
	(Sync): Don't adjust expand/fill settings of occupied sites.
	(ChildOccupancyChanged): When a site becomes occupied, reset its
	attach options.

	* stetic/WidgetBox.cs: Always have a GdkWindow, so that the
	background of a container can be clicked on to select it (if any
	background is visible). Fix up coordinate handling accordingly.

	* stetic/WidgetFactory.cs (DefaultWidgets): add VButtonBox and
	HButtonBox.

	* stetic/Makefile.am (stetic_exe_SOURCES): add
	HButtonBoxWrapper.cs, VButtonBoxWrapper.cs
	(stetic.exe): Use -pkg:gtk-sharp-2.0 rather than the output we
	already cached in configure.in, because Miggie says so. :)
