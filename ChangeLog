	* stetic/PropertyEditors.cs (Enum, Flags): implement these by
	using private classes rather than anonymous delegates, to work
	around 69614.

	* stetic/TableWrapper.cs: fix a search-and-replace-o ("placesite"
	instead of "placeholder")
	(Sync): Don't adjust expand/fill settings of occupied sites.
	(ChildOccupancyChanged): When a site becomes occupied, reset its
	attach options.

	* stetic/WidgetBox.cs: Always have a GdkWindow, so that the
	background of a container can be clicked on to select it (if any
	background is visible). Fix up coordinate handling accordingly.

	* stetic/WidgetFactory.cs (DefaultWidgets): add VButtonBox and
	HButtonBox.

	* stetic/Makefile.am (stetic_exe_SOURCES): add
	HButtonBoxWrapper.cs, VButtonBoxWrapper.cs
	(stetic.exe): Use -pkg:gtk-sharp-2.0 rather than the output we
	already cached in configure.in, because Miggie says so. :)
