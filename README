This is the beginnings of Stetic, which will eventually be a new GUI
designer for GNOME. At the moment, it is just a mostly useless demo of
certain bits of Gtk#.

To build Stetic you need Mono/MCS head (a recent 1.1.x release is
*probably* ok), and the very latest Gtk# (yesterday's snapshot is
probably too old).

FAQ:
	Q. "How do I--"
	A. You can't, it's not implemented yet.

	Q. "Why does--"
	A. Because it was just a quick hack. It will be different later.

	Q. "Can I--"
	A. No.

	Q. "But--"
	A. I'm sorry, which part of "mostly useless" didn't you
	understand?
